# Beacon
Beacon is the best way to store public ~persistent~ key-value data 
in the Open Internet. Data saved to Beacon is redundantly stored in
[`BitTorrent Tracker`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker),
[`ED2K`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey_network),
[`Kad`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kad_network),
and [`IPv6 DNS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address)(readonly, need to set manually).
